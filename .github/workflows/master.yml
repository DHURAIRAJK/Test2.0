# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: MuleSoft CI/CD Pipeline

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
 # pull_request:
 #   branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  #workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
#jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  #build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    #runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    #steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      #- uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      #- name: Run a one-line script
      #  run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      #- name: Run a multi-line script
      #  run: |
      #    echo Add other actions to build,
      #    echo test, and deploy your project.
